## Summary:

Refactoring can be time consuming if you cannot identify how your code can be refactored.  You also risk compromising the output if you refactor your code inaccurately.  However, if you can successfully refactor your code, your machine wonâ€™t have to run so hard to process the code and you will have your output much quicker.
