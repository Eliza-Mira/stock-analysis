## Summary:
Refactoring can be time consuming if you cannot identify opportunities how your code can be refactored and there is a of compromising the output editing your initial code inaccurately.  However, if you can successfully refactor your code, your machine wonâ€™t have to run so hard to process the code and you will have your output much quicker.
